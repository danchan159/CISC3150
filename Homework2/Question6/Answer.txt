Question 6:
In our class, we talked about how the Scanner class doesn't have a method 
for tokenizing individual characters. But you're hell bent on forcing the 
Scanner class to tokenize the individual characters. What should you set 
your delimiter to?

Answer:
To tokenize individual characters, set the delimiter to the empty string.
By default, Scanner separates words by finding chars that end in whitespace.
Instead of finding whitespace, setting the delimiter to the empty string ("")
causes the Scanner to tokenize by each character read.
